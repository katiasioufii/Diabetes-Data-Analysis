🩺 Diabetes Dataset Analysis
📊 Project Overview
In this project, I performed an in-depth data analysis on a large diabetes dataset containing 253,680 records and 22 features.
The goal was to identify which factors have the strongest influence on diabetes outcomes.

🛠️ Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Correlation Analysis

Data Visualization (e.g., Heatmaps, Pairplots)

Statistical Analysis

Machine Learning Feature Importance (optional: Random Forest, etc.)

🧩 Dataset Columns
The dataset includes health and demographic indicators such as:

HighBP (High Blood Pressure)

HighChol (High Cholesterol)

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Smoker, Stroke, Heart Disease, Physical Activity, Diet (Fruits/Veggies), Age, Sex, Income, and more.

🔎 Key Findings
Features like High Blood Pressure, BMI, Age, and General Health had the strongest correlation with diabetes.

Lifestyle factors like Smoking and Physical Activity also showed significant impact.

Socioeconomic factors like Income and Education had moderate effects on diabetes risk.

📈 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for optional feature importance)

🚀 Outcome
By analyzing the dataset, I was able to highlight the most influential factors related to diabetes.
This kind of analysis can help in designing better healthcare interventions and prevention strategies.
