# 🩺 Diabetes Dataset Analysis 📊

## Project Overview
In this project, I performed an in-depth data analysis on a large **diabetes dataset** containing **253,680 records** and **22 features**.  
The goal was to identify which factors have the strongest influence on diabetes outcomes.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Correlation Analysis
- Data Visualization (Heatmaps, Pairplots)
- Statistical Analysis
- Machine Learning Feature Importance (e.g., Random Forest)

---

## 🧩 Dataset Columns
The dataset includes health and demographic indicators such as:
- **HighBP** (High Blood Pressure)
- **HighChol** (High Cholesterol)
- **BMI** (Body Mass Index)
- **Smoker**
- **Stroke**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Physical Activity**
- **Diet** (Fruits/Veggies consumption)
- **Age**
- **Sex**
- **Income**
- **Education**
- *(and more)*

## 🔎 Key Findings
- Features like **High Blood Pressure**, **BMI**, **Age**, and **General Health** had the strongest correlation with diabetes.
- Lifestyle factors like **Smoking** and **Physical Activity** also showed significant impact.
- Socioeconomic factors like **Income** and **Education** had a moderate influence on diabetes risk.

## 📈 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** (for optional feature importance analysis)
